Today is a special occasion,
So I took my camera with me.
I have to make the moment perfect
For the two of us,
That I will immortalize in a picture,
Then add it to my collection of
Memories.

Today is a special day,
So I took my camera with me.
This day, I'm sure my life will change.
I have to make the moment perfect,
For my camera to capture in a photograph.
I then will add it to my collection of
Memories.

Today is not all that special,
But I took my camera with me.
I'm sure a moment will be important,
And therefore I have to make it perfect,
For my photoshoot that soon follows.
It then belongs in my collection of
Memories.

Today was supposed to be a special day
And I took my camera with me,
But it was completely ruined by 
A blurry camera lens and sudden rain.
And now, everytime I think about it
Or see it as part of my collection of 
Memories,

It makes me want to kill myself.
